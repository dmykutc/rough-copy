    <h1>BMW 5 Series (E60)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The BMW E60/E61 series is the fifth generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was sold from 2003 to 2010. The body styles of the range are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4-door sedan/saloon (E60 model code)</li>
        <li>5-door estate/wagon (E61 model code, marketed as "Touring")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The range was launched in 2003 in the sedan body style. In 2004, the estate body style was introduced. The E60/E61 was replaced by the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series_(F10)">F10/F11 5 Series</a> in 2010.</p>
    <p>The E60/E61 introduced various new electronic features to the 5 Series, including iDrive, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering and voice control. The E60/61 also was the first 5 Series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking. New safety features for the E60/E61 included adaptive headlights, night vision, active headrests, Lane Departure Warning and high intensity emergency brake lights. Unlike the three previous generations of 5 Series[6][7] and the F10 successor,[8] the E60/E61 centre console is not angled towards the driver.</p>
