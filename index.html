    <p>The BMW E60/E61 series is the fifth generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was sold from 2003 to 2010. The body styles of the range are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4-door sedan/saloon (E60 model code)</li>
        <li>5-door estate/wagon (E61 model code, marketed as "Touring")</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>The range was launched in 2003 in the sedan body style. In 2004, the estate body style was introduced. The E60/E61 was replaced by the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series_(F10)">F10/F11 5 Series</a> in 2010.</b></p>
    <p><b>The E60/E61 introduced various new electronic features to the 5 Series, including iDrive, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering and voice control. The E60/61 also was the first 5 Series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking. New safety features for the E60/E61 included adaptive headlights, night vision, active headrests, Lane Departure Warning and high intensity emergency brake lights. Unlike the three previous generations of 5 Series[6][7] and the F10 successor,[8] the E60/E61 centre console is not angled towards the driver.</b></p>

    <h2>Model year updates</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><b>2007 facelift</b></p>
    <p>The LCI (Life Cycle impulse) model was released for the 2007 model year. This LCI model included a facelift of the front and rear end of the vehicle. This update included a new front bumper, fog lights, headlights, tail lights and trunk; however these styling changes are relatively subtle.[15] Interior changes included door handles, position of power window buttons and an updated iDrive with programmable "favourite" shortcut buttons (for late 2008 models).</p>
    <p>The active cruise control was upgraded to bring the vehicle to a complete stop and accelerate from stationary (called" Stop & Go"). Other changes include adaptive headlights, LED rear lights, Lane Departure Warning,[12] night vision,[13] head-up display and Brake Force Display. The E60 LCI was the first BMW to feature regenerative braking.[14] On automatic transmission models, a shift by wire shifter replaced the mechanical version and shift paddles were available for the first time on a 5 Series model outside of the M5.[15]

The LCI update also included new engines and transmissions.</p>
